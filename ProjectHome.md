This is an Arduino project to drive two servos to direct an antenna at a moving drone (hexacopter in my case).  The Arduino receives a wireless serial stream from a MultiWii based drone (MWP 2.1) and uses the height and GPS LAT/LON to determine the heading and inclination of the antenna.   Not sure how unique trackers for MultiWii are, but here is one which can use the MultiWii V2.1 protocol directly.
